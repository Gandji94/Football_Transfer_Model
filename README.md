# Football Transfer Model
In the following project I have created a model that allows us to predict the transfer fees of football players. The project is divided into several steps
- Data collection & combination
- Exploratory analysis
- Training & testing the model
- Building the final model

The data was collected from TransferMarket.com (transfer fees) and FBREF.com (player statistics). We used the data to create data frames that were used for exploratory analysis and to train & test various machine learning models.

The final model allows us to predict the potential transfer fees of footballers with relatively good accuracy.
