# Football Transfer Model
In the following project I have created a model that allows us to predict the transfer fees of football players. The project is divided into several steps
- Data collection & combination (last update 2024)
- Exploratory analysis
- Training & testing the model
- Building the final model (Which features drive the transfer fee & creating prediction intervals)

The data was collected from TransferMarket.com (transfer fees) (https://www.transfermarkt.com/) and FBREF.com (player statistics) (https://fbref.com/en/). We used the data to create data frames that were used for exploratory analysis and to train & test various machine learning models.

Most current model is "updated_transfer_model.pkl". "5.1.3Topf_Transfer_Model.ipynb","7_Interpretability_of_the_Transfer_Model.ipynb",
 and "8_Prediction_intervals_forTransfer_Fees.ipynb" will provide insights how the model was trained, which features drove the prediction and what are representive prediction intervals.
